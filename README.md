This project was popularized and polished with the invaluable support of the [IT Bulgaria Discord server](http://discord.gg/dRrdYQf "Largest IT bulgarian Discord server").
Due to the contributing nature of the project and easy to use question addition utility, there are more than 10 question authors and ~600 questions in ~15 different categories.

## How to play

To start a new game you should send the new game command in discord channel. After sending the command the bot responds and sends the first question. It adds emojis of letters on the message of the question, with these the player can sumbit his answer.
